# JavaScript Design Patterns

## Requirements

### Part 1
- The application should display a picture of a cat and a number of clicks.
- The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

### Part 2
- The application should display two cats. Each cat includes
  - the cat's name
  - a picture of the cat
  - text showing the number of clicks
- The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.
